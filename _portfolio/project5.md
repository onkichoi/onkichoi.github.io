Worked with the UCL DCAL Research Centre and led the online design of the Moodle course. Adapted in-person summer school activities into online activities and created additional resources. The resources include interactive videos, quizzes, and digital games, such as a unique situational game made using Storyline with branching scenarios leading to different outcomes depending on the selected actions, simulating how students can overcome the challenges at the start of university life. Ensured the highest level of course accessibility for deaf or hard of hearing people, for example, by providing subtitles to all videos and clear course navigation instructions. I made sure to address reviewersâ€™ feedback to make a course that works for a wide audience.
