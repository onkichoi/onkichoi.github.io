I worked with the UCL DCAL Research Centre and led the online design of the Moodle course. Converted in-person summer school activities into online activities and created additional resources. The resources include interactive videos (containing simultaneous BSL interpretation), end-of-topic quizzes, and digital games, such as a unique situational game made using Storyline with branching scenarios leading to different outcomes depending on the selected actions, simulating how students overcome the challenges at the start of university life. I ensured the highest level of course accessibility for deaf or hard-of-hearing people, for example, by providing accurate English subtitles to all videos and clear course navigation instructions. I ran several rounds of reviewersâ€™ testing and addressed all feedback to attain the highest standard.
