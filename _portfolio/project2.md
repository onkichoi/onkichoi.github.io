'Raising Concerns' is a series of four short online courses for students at King’s College London, designed for undergraduates’ induction. I worked with the Student Experience Team of the Faculty towards the learning outcome of students understanding the procedures of reporting various concerns to the faculty. I worked with different stakeholders; staff and students reviewed the courses and gave comments during the development process.

The four topics are settings in which concerns are most likely to arise. Namely: about a peer, a tutor’s inappropriate behaviour, patient safety, and patient behaviour. Each course consists of colourfully illustrated cartoons pertaining to the example scenarios, audio narrations, an animated flow chart clearly showing the reporting route and timeline, and FAQs. This course was produced with Articulate Storyline.
