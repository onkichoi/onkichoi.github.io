King’s e-Portfolio is an online system for students in the Faculty of Dentistry, Oral & Craniofacial Sciences of King's College London to track their clinical practice experience and internships. Students provide information that is reviewed by peers and course teachers. I created a training video and written instructions to help students use the system.
