I evaluated a survey of all undergraduate dentistry students at King's College London, asking them about teaching delivery modes. During Covid-19, most classes were moved online, through a mix of recorded lectures and live sessions, while some clinical classes remained in-person. Students were asked for their preferences, such as which course elements they preferred in which teaching mode. A big part of the survey evaluation was the analysis and categorisation of free-text comments from students. The result was that students prefer a mix of different teaching modes, and the results of the survey informed the teaching offer in subsequent years.
