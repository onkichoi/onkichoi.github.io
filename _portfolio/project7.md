I created the online course materials ‘Biological tubes’ and ‘Endocrine System’ using Rise for the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care at King’s College London. I used images/animations that were created under the guidance of subject matter experts alongside the instructional text, together with different types of interactive (e.g. drag and drop) self-assessed quizzes.
