I worked on the online learning design of University College London’s seven short courses on 'Deaf Awareness Training' (2019 UCL Short Course Award winner) and one short course on 'Inclusion of Disabled and Neurodivergent People'. The audience is comprised of professionals from the health and education industries (e.g. audiologists, doctors, teachers, and healthcare professionals) and the courses are hosted on Moodle (LSM).

I worked closely with a subject matter expert to design and ensure the courses are engaging. I created images, charts, formative learning games, and summative quizzes using H5P and Moodle’s built-in quiz function. In addition, I made sure the courses met the strictest requirements of UCL’s digital accessibility policy. The courses passed rounds of meticulous review processes by review panels before the official release.
