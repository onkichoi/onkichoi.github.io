I was the online learning designer of UCL's seven short courses on Deaf Awareness Training (which won a UCL Short Course Award in 2019) and one short course on Inclusion of disabled and neurodivergent people. The audience are professionals (e.g. audiologists, doctors, teachers, healthcare professionals etc.) and the courses are hosted on Moodle (LSM).

I made sure the courses are as engaging as possible . I closely worked with a SME to align the learning outcomes, designed and developed the course content and multimedia from the beginning to end. Using adult learning theories such as behaviourism and multi-mode learning,  I created images, charts, formative learning games using H5P and summative quizzes using Moodle's built in quiz function. In addition I made sure the courses meet the top requirements of UCL's digital accessibility policy. The courses have passed rounds of meticulous review processes by review panels before they were officially released. Depending on the audience, some courses are accredited by their respective professional training bodies.
