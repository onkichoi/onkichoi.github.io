I was the online learning designer of University College London’s seven short courses on 'Deaf Awareness Training' (2019 UCL Short Course Award winner) and one short course on 'Inclusion of Disabled and Neurodivergent People'. The audience are professionals (e.g. audiologists, doctors, teachers, healthcare professionals) and the courses are hosted on Moodle (LSM).

I worked closely with a subject matter expert to align the learning outcomes. I designed and developed the course content and multimedia from beginning to end incorporating adult learning theories such as behaviourism and multi-mode learning to ensure the courses are engaging. I created images, charts, formative learning games, and summative quizzes using H5P and Moodle’s built-in quiz function. In addition, I made sure the courses met the strict requirements of UCL’s digital accessibility policy. The courses passed rounds of meticulous review processes by review panels before official release. The courses are accredited by relevant professional training bodies.
