King’s e-Portfolio is a brand-new online system for students in the Faculty of Dentistry, Oral & Craniofacial Sciences of King’s College London to track their clinical practice experience and internships. Through the online system, students can easily submit information via electronic forms and receive feedback and response from peers and course teachers. I created a training video and written instructions to help students use the system.
