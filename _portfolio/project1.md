E-Portfolio is a brand-new online system for students in the Faculty of Dentistry, Oral & Craniofacial Sciences of King’s College London to track their clinical practice experience and internships throughout their study. Through this new online system, it is much easier to submit information via electronic forms and receive instant feedback and response from peers and course teachers. I created a short 2-minute training video and written instructions to help students use the system.
