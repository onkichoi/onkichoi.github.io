In 2020, King's Faculty of Dentistry, Oral & Craniofacial Sciences introduced advanced 'phantom-head' dental simulators and virtual haptic machines simulate physical touch, integrating clinical digital learning. They help continue providing the best education and training in the field of dentistry when the pandemic hit.
This new curriculum has won the Technological or Digital Innovation of the Year trophy at the seventeenth annual Times Higher Education (THE) Awards.

To supplement in-person teaching and help students getting familiar with the machines' operation, I filmed and created an introduction video and three user guides on three topics, namly 'Setting up the Simulator', 'Operating the Haptic Simulation Application', and 'Troubleshooting the Haptic Simulator' using Articulate Rise. They are used by more than 200 undergraduate students. Interactive elements are used, for example, using image hotspots indicating different parts of the machine.
