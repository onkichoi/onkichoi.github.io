In 2020, King’s Faculty of Dentistry, Oral & Craniofacial Sciences introduced advanced ‘phantom-head’ dental simulators and virtual haptic machines that simulate physical touch, integrating clinical digital learning. They helped continue providing the best education and training in the field of dentistry when the pandemic hit. This new curriculum has won the Technological or Digital Innovation of the Year trophy at the seventeenth annual Times Higher Education (THE) Awards.

To supplement in-person teaching and help students get familiar with the machines’ operation, I created an introduction video and three user guides on three topics, namely ‘Setting up the Simulator’, ‘Operating the Haptic Simulation Application’, and ‘Troubleshooting the Haptic Simulator’ using Articulate Rise. More than 600 undergraduate students have used the materials. Interactive elements are employed, for example, image hotspots indicating different parts of the machine.
