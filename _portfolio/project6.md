I worked with a module lead to create multiple SharePoint pages for students to upload personal volunteering blogs and course portfolios. I created and have been managing the backend of >1000 SharePoint sub-pages and multimedia files, as well as handling regular tasks e.g. giving appropriate permissions to teachers and students, resolving any enquiry from the users, etc. I also created a short video for students explaining and demonstrating the functions of SharePoint.
