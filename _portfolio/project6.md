I worked with a module lead to create 3 SharePoint pages for students uploading personal volunteering blogs and course portfolios. I created and have been managing the backend of >1000 SharePoint sub pages and multimedia files, as well as handling regular tasks e.g. giving appropriate permissions to teachers and students, resolving any enquiries from the users, etc. I also created a short video for students explaining and demonstrating the functions of SharePoint.
