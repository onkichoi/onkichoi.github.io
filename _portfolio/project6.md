I created 3 SharePoint pages for students to allow them to upload personal volunteering blogs and course portfolios. I created a short video for students demonstrating the functions of SharePoint. I am in charge of the regular backend management of >600 SharePoint sub pages, e.g. enrollment, giving appropriate permissions to teachers and students, resolved any technical bugs that may happen on the site, etc.
